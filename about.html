							<h3>Baila UP</h3>

									<h5>Lize</h5>
									<p id="jump-to-melinda" class="lize"><span class="image left"><img src="images/lize-headshot.webp" alt="headshot of Lize" loading="lazy"/></span>I started partner dancing in 2008, and it has been one of my favorite things to do ever since. I love how social dancing combines all the benefits of exercise with the opportunity to socialize, enjoy music, and express yourself artistically. Learning a dance like salsa is like learning a new language - that you can use anywhere in the world. I love the community that has formed as a result of dancing at Baila Up.</p>

									<h5>Melinda</h5>
									<p id="jump-to-michael" class="melinda"><span class="image left"><img src="images/melinda-headshot.webp" alt="headshot of Melinda" loading="lazy"/></span>If you've got a heartbeat, you have rhythm and you can dance! I teach dance so I can share the joy of rhythm, movement, and connection with others. I've been dancing individually all of my life and was fortunate to be introduced to social dancing early on. Partnered dancing challenges individual coordination and musicality as well as teamwork and social skills. As a dancer, I aim to practice gratitude and generosity in every dance, with every person I meet. As a teacher, I am to offer an entry point to partner dancing to everyone, no matter their skill level, using a range of progressive exercises.</p>

									<h5>Michael</h5>

I taught full-time in Grand Rapids, MI for three years, and enjoy the occassional chance to teach when the opportunity arises. Most recently, I performed in the Nutcracker as Father Christmas (a Drosslemeier-esque character). On May 3rd, 2025, I will perform with <a href="https://www.northernskydance.com/">Northern Sky Dance</a> in their production of Wizard of Oz!</p>

							<h3>Baila UP</h3>
							<p>We believe dancing is for everyone and our goal is to create opportunities for you to learn and participate in social dancing in the Marquette area. We welcome beginners and experienced dancers alike. During lessons we rotate partners, so it's always okay to come solo.</p>
							<p>We're always happy to collaborate with other individuals, groups, or organizations in the area. If you have an idea, let us know!</p>

							<h3>Teachers</h3>
							<h4>Lize Loubser</h4>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/lize-headshot.webp" alt="headshot of Lize Loubser"/></span>I started partner dancing in 2008, and it has been one of my favorite things to do ever since. I love how social dancing combines all the benefits of exercise with the opportunity to socialize, enjoy music, and express yourself artistically. Learning a dance like salsa is like learning a new language - that you can use anywhere in the world. I love the community that has formed as a result of dancing at Baila Up.</p>

							<h4>Melinda Loubser</h4>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/melinda-loubser-headshot.webp" alt="headshot of Melinda Loubser"/></span>If you've got a heartbeat, you have rhythm and you can dance! I teach dance so I can share the joy of rhythm, movement, and connection with others. I've been dancing individually all of my life and was fortunate to be introduced to social dancing early on. Partnered dancing challenges individual coordination and musicality as well as teamwork and social skills. As a dancer, I aim to practice gratitude and generosity in every dance, with every person I meet. As a teacher, I am to offer an entry point to partner dancing to everyone, no matter their skill level, using a range of progressive exerrcises.</p>

							<h4>Michael Pollock</h4>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/michael-pollock-headshot.webp" alt="headshot of Michael Pollock"/></span>I have taught and professionally competed in ballroom and social dance, and enjoy participating in local dance events as well. I taught full-time in Grand Rapids, MI for three years, and enjoy the occassional chance to teach when the opportunity arises. Most recently, I performed in the Nutcracker as Father Christmas (a Drosslemeier-esque character). On May 3rd, 2025, I will perform with Northern Sky Dance in their production of Wizard of Oz!</p>

							<h3>Dance Zone Marquette</h3>
							<p>Baila UP would not exist without the generosity of Dance Zone Marquette and Marge Sklar in allowing us to use their space.</p>
